                <h2>Fullstack Junior Developer - Wife & Mother - Homestead Entrepreneur</h2>
                <p>When asked the question: Who Am I? Many thoughts come to mind... A single child raised in a small town. A woman whose dreams were a family. A girl who fell in love with the simple life and aspired to own a farm of her own one day. When looking back at all of my accomplishments I find that I have been successful in all aspects of my life except one. What is my career? A question I found myself asking quite often. As hard work is not something I shy away from, I found myself inspired by Fullstack Academy. Fullstack Junior Developer has added itself to my list of goals and like all other aspects of my life I will be successful.</p>
